v0.48 - various bug fixes
      - Added Smart Skills.  Smart Skills allows you to map skills to weapons based on
        item type or augment effect.  See CONFIG.INI for examples, I have included
        a decrypted optiondata_client.txt so you can look up augment effect ID's.
        Augment Skill Names have the prefix "Item: " stripped.
v0.47 - Significant changes to COunter Hide to make it smarter and find players
        who hid and restarted!
      - Fixed IG<->L2NET disconnect from restarting and most other restart issues.
v0.46 - Fixes to CounterDisarm, Hold Target, Player list.
      - Fixes to MessageFilter
v0.45 - Party members now excluded from playerlist, clan members targeting healers
        also exlcuded.
      - RequestRestart now managed so hold target does not disconnect you if you
        are at a char select screen.  Previously if you had the script running and
        restarted, the game would make you untarget since you were not in game workd
        and hold target would try and retarget your last object.  This would d/c you
        9/10.
      - AEGIS::HoldTarget::Process::RequestTC now wakes up the client queue thread
v0.44 - fixed dead players showing on player list, cleaned up some debugging messages
v0.43 - significant changes to how CharInfo and UserInfo are processed / stored
      - significant rewrite of MyCharacter.l2c, Charlist.l2c, functions leveraging
        those two classes.  This should significantly improve latency on those
        packet handlers.
